       `amount` is a SNAPSHOT of what the services cost when the booking was
       made, in Rand. It is not derived from the Service documents at read
       time on purpose: prices change, and a booking has to keep charging —
       and keep showing — the figure the customer actually agreed to.

       It is also what the Paystack charge is verified against, so it must
       be computed server-side from the service IDs and never accepted from
       the request body. A client that can name its own price will. */

   an in-memory SORT stage, which is the slow part these are meant to
