            At Patrick Dreadlocks &amp; Beauty, we believe every woman deserves
            to feel beautiful and confident. What began as a single chair in
            Kempton Park grew into a salon built around one idea — that hair
            you plan to keep for years deserves to be treated that way.

            Our specialists start, grow and maintain locs, install braids and
            wigs, and finish cuts and colour — with nails, brows and skin under
            the same roof. Every appointment is personal, every product is
            premium, and nobody leaves a chair before they are happy.
