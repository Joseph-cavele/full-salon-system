/**
 * Bring the database's indexes in line with what the schemas declare.
 *
 * Mongoose's `autoIndex` creates missing indexes on its own but never drops
 * ones that are no longer declared, so a schema that loses an index leaves the
 * old one behind — still consuming writes and RAM, invisible from the code.
 * `syncIndexes()` closes that gap: it creates what's missing AND drops what
 * isn't declared, per model.
 *
 * Run it after changing any `schema.index(...)` call:
 *
 *   npm run sync-indexes
 *
 * Safe to re-run — it's a no-op once the database already matches.
 *
 * Note it will drop indexes you created by hand in Atlas but never declared in
 * a schema. That's the intent (the schemas are the source of truth), but it's
 * worth knowing before the first run against production.
