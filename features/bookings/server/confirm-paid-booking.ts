 * Both the browser callback and the webhook call this, and either can arrive
 * first — or twice, since Paystack retries webhooks. So it has to be
 * idempotent, and the idempotency is enforced by a conditional update rather
 * than a read-then-write: two concurrent calls would both pass an `if
 * (booking.paymentStatus !== "PAID")` check and both send an email. The
 * `findOneAndUpdate` below only matches a booking that is NOT already paid, so
 * exactly one caller gets a document back and sends the confirmation.
